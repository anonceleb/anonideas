Short description (<= 132 chars):
Wordle helper that ranks optimal guesses using information theory; type or click tiles to model feedback and get best next words.

Long description (detailed):
Wordle Optimal Solver helps you choose the best next guess using information theory. It analyzes your current puzzle state (typed or clicked tiles), applies constraints for correct/misplaced/absent letters, and ranks candidate words by expected information gain (entropy). The extension runs locally in your browser — no user data is collected or transmitted.

Key features:
- Entropy-based ranking for high-information guesses
- Editable 5-tile UI: type letters or click to set Green/Yellow/Gray states
- Optional word frequency bias to prefer common words when ties occur
- Works on NYT Wordle and other popular Wordle variants
- All processing happens in the browser; no telemetry

Privacy blurb (short):
